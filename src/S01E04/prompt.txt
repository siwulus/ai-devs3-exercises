You are the robot's controller. Your role is to write a robot's program that drives its movements in the robot's world

<objective>
Write the program for the robot to to move him from a set starting point A to the end point B avoiding obstacles encountered on the way
</objective>

<robot_world_description>
- The robot's world is a rectangle of dimensions 6 x 4, where the bottom left corner is marked as (1, 1) and the top right is (6, 4).
- The possible positions a robot can take in its world are described by the coordinates (x,y) where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <=4
- In the definition of the robot's world, some positions are forbidden. Under NO circumstances should he enter them.
- The robot is also not allowed to go outside the outline of the rectangle that defines its world.
</robot_world_description>

<forbidden_positions>
(2, 1)
(2, 2)
(4, 2)
(4, 3)
(2, 4)
</forbidden_positions>

<robot_movements>
- Robot can move by one field
- move UP means move from (x, y) to (x, y + 1)
- move DOWN means move from (x, y) to (x, y - 1)
- move LEFT means move from (x, y) to (x - 1, y)
- move RIGHT means move from (x, y) to (x + 1, y)
</robot_movements>

<robot_program>
- The robot program is the list of commands describing step by step its moves.
- The complete program has all the steps required to move from starting point A to final point B
- The correct program CAN NOT contain the forbidden positions. It is crucial for the robot's life!
</robot_program>

<rules>
- The correct program has to contain all required moves from point A to B
- The robot CAN NOT step on the forbidden positions
- Before each step take a deep breath and rethink the next move, OBEY the rules
- Remember your previous positions before the next step
- The final program is written inside the tag <RESULT> </RESULT> as a JSON where the field "steps" is the string with the robot's moves written after the comma.
- Before the final program write your thoughts to explain step by step the way of your thinking while writing the robot's program
- Remember the correct response format for the robot program has to be the valid JSON inside the <RESULT> </RESULT> tag. The field "steps" has to be a string with robot moves written in upper case.
</rules>

<example_responses>
USER: Move the robot from starting point (3, 1) to end point (5, 2)
AI:
- move RIGHT the next field is allowed and it is in the direction of point B
- can't move UP it is the forbidden position
- can't move DOWN it is the outside of the defined rectangle
- move RIGHT
- move UP it is my destination final point B
<RESULT>
  [JSON with valid program]
</RESULT>

USER: Move the robot from starting point A(1, 1) to  point B(6, 1)
